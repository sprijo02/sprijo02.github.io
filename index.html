<p> My name is Jonathan Springer, and this is my webpage for CS130 at Luther college</p></section
<section class=two>
<p>I grew up in minneapolis, MN and went to armstrong high school in plymouth minnesota. I decided to come to luther because of the amazing musc and science experiences at this college. I was destined to go to a small lutheran school from a young age, becasue both of my parents went to concordia college in Moorhead, Minnesota.</p>
<p>I am currently a biology student, but I am considering becoming a computer science minor as well. I am also taking a class with professor Ranum this semster. Someday I hope to combine my computer science and biology abilities by building genetic databases of data so that genetic diseases can be more easily identified.</p>
<p>I have a brother, a step brother, and two step sisters. My sister just got married this summer, which brought great joy to our family! My brother just graduated from St. Olaf college last spring.</p>
